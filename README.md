# Stopwatch-Webpage

The Stopwatch application offers straightforward functionality:

Start Button: Clicking the start button initiates the timer. If the timer is at 0, it begins from the start; otherwise, it resumes from where it was last stopped.

Stop Button: Pressing the stop button halts the timer.

Reset Button: Clicking the reset button stops the timer (if running) and sets it back to 0.
